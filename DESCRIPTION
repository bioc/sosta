Description: `sosta` (Spatial Omics STructure Analysis) is a package for analyzing
    spatial omics data to explore tissue organization at the anatomical structure level.
    It reconstructs morphologically relevant structures based on molecular features 
    or cell types. It further calculates a range of structural and shape metrics
    to quantitatively describe tissue architecture. The package is designed to integrate 
    with other packages for the analysis of spatial (omics) data.
