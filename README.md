# Spatial Omic Structure Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

`sosta` (spatial omics structure analysis) is a framework to
reconstruct, characterise and compare spatial structures from spatial
omics data.

`sosta` builds on existing R packages for spatial analysis such as
`spatstat`, `sf` and the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/)
environment by integrating with packages `SpatialExperiment` and
`SpatialFeatureExperiment`, which facilitates the implementation of
additional custom metrics that fit the needs of users.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `sosta` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sgunz/sosta")
```
