# Spatial Omic Structure Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`sosta` (spatial omics structure analysis) is a framework to
reconstruct, characterise and compare spatial structures from spatial
omics data.

`sosta` builds on existing R packages for spatial analysis such as
`spatstat`, `sf` and `SpatialFeatureExperiment`, which facilitates the
implementation of additional custom metrics that fit the needs of users.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `sosta` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sgunz/sosta")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(sosta)
## basic example code
```
